1. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene N is analogous to the ' nerdy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene N has large, prominent eyes that stand out, much like thick-rimmed glasses.
* Gene P is associated with the ' prickly ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene P is covered with sharp bristles, giving it a spiky texture. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

68. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.

95. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene B is linked with the ' bumpy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene B has a skin texture that is not smooth, but rough with small bumps all over.
* Gene W is correlated with the ' waxy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene W has a thick protective layer that is water resistant and opague. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
