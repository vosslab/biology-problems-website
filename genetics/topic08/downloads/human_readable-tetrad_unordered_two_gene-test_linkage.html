Using the table above, determine the linkage between the two genes.
- [ ] A. The two genes are LINKED but are likely on DIFFERENT chromosomes.
- [ ] B. The two genes are UNLINKED and on the SAME chromosome.
- [*] C. The two genes are LINKED and on the SAME chromosome.
- [ ] D. The two genes are BOTH linked AND unlinked .
- [ ] E. The two genes are NEITHER linked NOR unlinked .
- [ ] F. The two genes are UNLINKED and likely on DIFFERENT chromosomes.


96. Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene E is affiliated with the ' elephant ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene E cells absorb excessive amounts of liquid, resulting in giant, swollen cells. 
* Gene H is analogous to the ' hairy ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene H cells develop long, thread-like filaments that extend outward, creating a hairy, shaggy texture on the colony. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

97. Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene J is analogous to the ' jeweled ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene J colonies appear dotted with tiny, iridescent spots that sparkle under light. 
* Gene T is analogous to the ' toxic ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene T secretes a toxic compound that inhibits or kills other microbial colonies nearby. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

98. Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene M is connected with the ' militant ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene M colonies are small, dense, and secrete compounds that inhibit the growth of nearby colonies. 
* Gene W is related to the ' webbed ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene W colonies produce delicate, web-like strands that connect neighboring colonies in a cobweb pattern. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

99. Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene A is related to the ' amber ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene A cells develop a rich yellow-orange pigmentation, giving the colony a warm, amber hue. 
* Gene E is associated with the ' elephant ' phenotype. A budding yeast that is homozygous recessive for Gene E cells absorb excessive amounts of liquid, resulting in giant, swollen cells. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
