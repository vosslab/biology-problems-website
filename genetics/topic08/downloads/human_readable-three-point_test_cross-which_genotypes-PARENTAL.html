1. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene D is analogous to the ' dewy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene D appears moist, with its body covered in tiny droplets of water.
* Gene R is connected with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal.
* Gene T is associated with the ' tipsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene T moves in an erratic path, suggesting a lack of coordination, as if intoxicated. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the parental genotype combinations . These are the allele combinations that the parent fruit flies originally carried.
More than one genotype will be correct. Select all that apply.

21. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene D is correlated with the ' dewy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene D appears moist, with its body covered in tiny droplets of water.
* Gene J is correlated with the ' jerky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene J moves in rapid and sudden movements, displaying an unpredictable flight pattern.
* Gene Y is affiliated with the ' yucky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene Y gives off an unpleasant odor and has a generally unappealing look. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

82. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
