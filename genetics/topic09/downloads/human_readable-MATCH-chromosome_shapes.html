98. Match each of the following categories of chromosome shape with their corresponding shape descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.    Acrocentric / A. the centromere is very offset from the center leading to a very short arm
- 2. Submetacentric / B. a chromosome with slightly shorter p arm relative to q arm
- 3.    Metacentric / C. a chromosome with two arms of equal length
- 4.       Acentric / D. spindle fibers cannot attach and the chromosome is lost when the cell divides
- 5.      Dicentric / E. a chromosome with formed through the fusion of two chromosome segments, each with a centromere


99. Match each of the following categories of chromosome shape with their corresponding shape descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.    Acrocentric / A. the short arm of the chromosome is so short that it is hard to observe
- 2. Submetacentric / B. a slight asymmetry in the length of the two chromosome arms
- 3.       Acentric / C. an abnormal chromosome that lacks a centromere
- 4.      Dicentric / D. an abnormal chromosome with two centromere s that often appear in cancer cells
- 5.    Metacentric / E. the centromere divides the chromosome into two arms with equal length
