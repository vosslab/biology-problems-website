98. Restriction enzymes are proteins that cut DNA at specific sequences to produce fragments for further study. These enzymes are obtained from various types of bacteria and have the ability to recognize short nucleotide sequences within a larger DNA molecule.
The restriction enzyme we are focusing on is EcoRV and is obtained from the bacteria Escherichia coli J62 pLG74.
 EcoRV cuts the DNA sequence as follows: 5'-GAT|ATC-3' where the '|' indicates the cut location.
Based on this info, can you identify the type of cut this enzyme makes?
- [ ] A. hanger end
- [ ] B. straight edge
- [ ] C. overhang end
- [ ] D. sticky end
- [*] E. blunt end


99. Restriction enzymes are proteins that cut DNA at specific sequences to produce fragments for further study. These enzymes are obtained from various types of bacteria and have the ability to recognize short nucleotide sequences within a larger DNA molecule.
The restriction enzyme we are focusing on is BstBI and is obtained from the bacteria Bacillus stearothermophilus B225.
 BstBI cuts the DNA sequence as follows: 5'-TT|CGAA-3' where the '|' indicates the cut location.
Based on this info, can you identify the type of cut this enzyme makes?
