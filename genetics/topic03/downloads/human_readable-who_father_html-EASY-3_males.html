1. The Question Who is the father of the child? 
[TABLE]
 BackgroundRestriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is a molecular biology technique used to distinguish between closely related DNA samples. It's commonly employed in paternity tests, among other applications.
DisclaimerIn actual diagnostic processes, the results of RFLP for confirming paternity are often cited to provide a 99.9% accuracy level or higher. However, no test is foolproof. Legal confirmation may involve additional procedures and evaluations to ensure the integrity and admissibility of the test.
InstructionsUse the provided DNA gel profile to determine paternity. Each band in the gel corresponds to a DNA fragment. Fragments are inherited; thus, the child's DNA will have overlapping fragments with the true father.

 BackgroundRestriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is a molecular biology technique used to distinguish between closely related DNA samples. It's commonly employed in paternity tests, among other applications.
DisclaimerIn actual diagnostic processes, the results of RFLP for confirming paternity are often cited to provide a 99.9% accuracy level or higher. However, no test is foolproof. Legal confirmation may involve additional procedures and evaluations to ensure the integrity and admissibility of the test.
InstructionsUse the provided DNA gel profile to determine paternity. Each band in the gel corresponds to a DNA fragment. Fragments are inherited; thus, the child's DNA will have overlapping fragments with the true father.

InstructionsUse the provided DNA gel profile to determine paternity. Each band in the gel corresponds to a DNA fragment. Fragments are inherited; thus, the child's DNA will have overlapping fragments with the true father.
