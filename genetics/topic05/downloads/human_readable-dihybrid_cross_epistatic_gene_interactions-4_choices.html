- [ ] A. These two genes show duplicate interaction epistasis When either gene is dominant, it hides the effects of the other gene.
- [ ] B. These two genes show duplicate recessive epistasis When either gene is homozygous recessive, it hides the effect of the other gene.
- [ ] C. These two genes show recessive epistasis When the first gene is homozygous recessive, it hides the phenotype of the second gene.
- [*] D. These two genes show digenic inheritance Interaction of two genes affect the phenotypic expression of a single trait.
