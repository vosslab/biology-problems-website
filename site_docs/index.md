# **Welcome to Biology Problems**

*Biology Problems* is a resource hub for **professors and educators** to access free and open problem sets for Biochemistry, Genetics, and more.

## **Daily Puzzles**
Daily puzzles designed to strengthen biology knowledge.

- **[Peptidyle](daily_puzzles/peptidyle.md)**  A daily pentapeptide puzzle. Your job is to solve the sequence from molecular structure to form a five-letter word.

- **[Deletion mutants](daily_puzzles/deletion_mutants.md)**  A daily *Drosophila* deletion mutant puzzle where you deduce the correct order of genes on a chromosome to form a five-letter word.

- **[Mutant screen](daily_puzzles/mutant_screen.md)**  A daily *Neurospora* auxotroph puzzle based on the classic Beadle and Tatum experiments. Deduce the metabolic pathway order from growth data to form a five-letter word.

## **Subjects**
Complete, chapter-by-chapter collections of homework and exam questions.

- **[Biochemistry](biochemistry/index.md)** Problem sets covering first-semester biochemistry topics, including macromolecules, pKa, and enzyme kinetics.

- **[Genetics](genetics/index.md)** Problem sets for a post-general biology inheritance genetics course, including Punnett squares, gene mapping, and deletion mutants.

## **Additional Topics**
Collections of selected homework and exam questions.
