  We need to generate a concise title that classifies these problems. The two problems
  both ask to determine the type of enzyme inhibition or activation. Problem 1: end
  product J binds allosterically to enzyme 1, decreases activity: that''s non-competitive
  inhibition? Actually end product binds away from active site, decreasing activity:
  that''s non-competitive inhibition (or allosteric inhibition). Problem 2: end product
  I binds allosterically to enzyme 1, increases activity: that''s allosteric activation
  (non-competitive activation). So both problems are about determining type of inhibition
  or activation.


  So title: Determining Enzyme Inhibition or Activation Type.


  We need to use Task + Topic + Key Detail format. Task: Determining. Topic: Enzyme
  Inhibition or Activation. Key detail: End product allosteric effect. So "Determining
  Enzyme Inhibition or Activation by End Product Binding".


  We need to keep concise and accessible. Avoid complex terms but can use inhibition/activation.


  Probably "Determining Enzyme Inhibition or Activation by End Product Binding".


  Alternatively "Determining Allosteric Inhibition or Activation". But the problems
  ask for type, not allosteric per se.


  Given guidelines: "Determining Enzyme Inhibition and Activation in Metabolic Pathways"
  already exists in sample. That might be close. But we should provide a single title
  for both problems. So maybe "Determining Enzyme Inhibition or Activation in a Metabolic
  Pathway".


  But key detail: binding at a location far from active site. So "Determining Allosteric
  Inhibition or Activation in a Metabolic Pathway".


  Better: "Determining Allosteric Inhibition or Activation in a Metabolic Pathway".


  Task: Determining, Topic: Allosteric Inhibition or Activation, Key Detail: Metabolic
  Pathway.


  Thus final answer: Determining Allosteric Inhibition or Activation in a Metabolic
  Pathway.

  ...done thinking.
