bbq-kaleidoscope_ladder_unknown_band-questions.txt: 'Calculating Molecular Weight
  from SDS-PAGE Ladder


  This title captures the essence of both problem statements, which involve analyzing
  an SDS-PAGE gel image to calculate the molecular weight of a protein band based
  on its migration distance compared to a known ladder. The focus is on using the
  relationship between the logarithm of molecular weight and migration distance to
  perform this calculation.'
