- 3.   ion exchange column (IEX) / C. charged proteins interact with an oppositely charged chromatography particle resin
- 4.  reverse phase column (RPC) / D. for one type, gradients of increasing organic solvent concentration are used to affect separation s


96. Match each of the following types of column chromatography with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.   ion exchange column (IEX) / A. charged proteins interact with an oppositely charged chromatography particle resin
- 2.        affinity column (AC) / B. works using resin-attached ligand s to grab hold of the corresponding proteins
- 3.  reverse phase column (RPC) / C. separates by surface hydrophobicity, particle binding is controlled by salt concentration and/or organic solvents
- 4. gel filtration column (GFC) / D. only liquid chromatography method where molecules do NOT bind to the chromatography particles


97. Match each of the following types of column chromatography with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.        affinity column (AC) / A. works using resin-attached ligand s to grab hold of the corresponding proteins
- 2.   ion exchange column (IEX) / B. separate by charge, particle binding is controlled by pH of the solvent mobile phase
- 3. size-exclusion column (SEC) / C. ability to separate protein samples by size using porous particles
- 4.  reverse phase column (RPC) / D. technique based on the ability to separate proteins based on relative hydrophobic differences


98. Match each of the following types of column chromatography with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.                 affinity column (AC) / A. ligand -attached beads bind directly to the protein of interest
- 2. hydrophobic interaction column (HIC) / B. separates proteins according to differences in their surface hydrophobicity
- 3.            ion exchange column (IEX) / C. charged proteins interact with an oppositely charged chromatography particle resin
- 4.          gel filtration column (GFC) / D. ability to separate protein samples by size using porous particles


99. Match each of the following types of column chromatography with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1. hydrophobic interaction column (HIC) / A. separates by surface hydrophobicity, particle binding is controlled by salt concentration and/or organic solvents
- 2.            ion exchange column (IEX) / B. separation method essentially based on the net charge of the protein
- 3.          size-exclusion column (SEC) / C. only liquid chromatography method where molecules do NOT bind to the chromatography particles
- 4.                 affinity column (AC) / D. works using resin-attached ligand s to grab hold of the corresponding proteins
