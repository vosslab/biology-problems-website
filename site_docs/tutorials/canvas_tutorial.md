## **Part 1: Upload Questions**
In this section, we will upload the questions to Canvas using QTI .zip files. This format allows you to easily transfer the questions into Canvas and get them ready for use in quizzes.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Settings:** On the bottom left-hand side of your course, click on **Settings**.

## **Part 2 (Optional): Rename your Question Bank**
Now that we have uploaded the questions to Canvas, we can rename the file to make it easier to identify the question bank when setting up the randomization process.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Quizzes:** On the middle left-hand side of your course, click on **Quizzes**.
![Canvas course navigation menu with the “Quizzes” link highlighted by a red box and arrow.](canvas_how_to/Step_02_01-select_Quizzes.png){ width=45% }

2. **In the top-right corner**, click the three dots next to the **+ Quiz button**. A drop-down menu will appear. Then, click on **Manage Question Banks**.
