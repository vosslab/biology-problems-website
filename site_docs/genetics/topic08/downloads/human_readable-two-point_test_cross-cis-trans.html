1. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene K is analogous to the ' kidney ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene K has a body shape that is curved, similar to a kidney bean.

It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene J is correlated with the ' jerky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene J moves in rapid and sudden movements, displaying an unpredictable flight pattern.
* Gene R is associated with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The phenotype counts resulting from the cross are summarized in the table above.
Question Using the data presented in the table to determine the configuration of the alleles on the parental chromosomes. Determine whether the alleles for the two genes are in a cis (on the same chromosome) or trans (on different chromosomes) configuration.
- [*] A. cis
- [ ] B. trans
- [ ] C. both
- [ ] D. neither
- [ ] E. cannot be determined


97. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.

For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene R is connected with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal.
* Gene T is linked with the ' tipsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene T moves in an erratic path, suggesting a lack of coordination, as if intoxicated. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The phenotype counts resulting from the cross are summarized in the table above.

Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene M is associated with the ' mushy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene M feels soft to the touch and unusually squishy, unlike the usual firmness.
* Gene P is analogous to the ' prickly ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene P is covered with sharp bristles, giving it a spiky texture. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The phenotype counts resulting from the cross are summarized in the table above.

For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene E is correlated with the ' eery ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene E appears to have something off, crooked limbs and other twisted appendages.
* Gene J is linked with the ' jerky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene J moves in rapid and sudden movements, displaying an unpredictable flight pattern. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The phenotype counts resulting from the cross are summarized in the table above.
