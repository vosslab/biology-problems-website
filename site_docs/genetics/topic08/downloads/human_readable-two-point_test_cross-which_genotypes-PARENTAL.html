1. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene E is related to the ' eery ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene E appears to have something off, crooked limbs and other twisted appendages.
* Gene R is linked with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene B is correlated with the ' bumpy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene B has a skin texture that is not smooth, but rough with small bumps all over.
* Gene J is related to the ' jerky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene J moves in rapid and sudden movements, displaying an unpredictable flight pattern. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Review the phenotype counts shown in the table. Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the possible parental genotype combinations . These are the allele combinations that the parent fruit flies originally carried. More than one combination will be correct. Select all that apply.

99. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene A is related to the ' artsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene A has wings that are colorful and distinctive patterns.
* Gene P is connected with the ' prickly ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene P is covered with sharp bristles, giving it a spiky texture. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
