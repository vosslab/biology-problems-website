1. Hemophilia A (HemA) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the HEMA gene. This results in blood cannot clot properly due to a deficiency of a clotting factor. The disorder affects 1 in 1,000 American males. Individuals affected with HemA have prolonged bleeding from common injuries. The defective gene for HemA is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28.
 Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by an increase in trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene. This results in a mutated Huntington protein that is toxic to certain cell types, particularly brain cells. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 adults of European descent. Individuals affected with HD have physical abilities that gradually worsen and mental abilities that decline into dementia. The defective gene for HD is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.
