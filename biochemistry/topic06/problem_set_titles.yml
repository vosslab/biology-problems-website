bbq-MATCH-energy_terms-questions.txt: 'Thinking...

  We need to produce a descriptive section heading that classifies these types of
  problems. The problems are "Match each energy requirement category with its corresponding
  energy term. Note: Each choice will be used exactly once." So it''s a Matching question
  type, with energy terms. The task verb should be "Matching" according to instructions.
  The heading should be concise and informative, Task + Topic + Key Detail format.
  So: "Matching Energy Requirement Categories with Energy Terms". Or maybe "Matching
  Energy Terms to Requirement Categories". Use simple language. Should we include
  the filename? The filename root is MATCH-energy_terms, which matches. So heading:
  "Matching Energy Requirement Categories to Energy Terms". That is concise and fits.
  Let''s follow the format: "Matching Energy Terms to Requirement Categories". Or
  "Matching Energy Requirement Categories with Energy Terms". I''ll choose: "Matching
  Energy Requirement Categories with Energy Terms". That is clear. No extra punctuation.
  Just plain text.

  We need a single title that classifies these problems: all are about determining
  true or false statements about thermodynamics and kinetics. The filename suggests
  TFMS-thermodynamics, meaning True/False Multiple Choice? The task: Determining True/False
  statements. So title: Determining True or False Statements About Thermodynamics

bbq-WOMC-energy_terms-questions.txt: 'Thinking...

  We need to produce a title following guidelines: Task + Topic + Key Detail. The
  tasks are identifying categories. The topic: energy terms categories? The key detail:
  energy term categories correspond to energy requirement categories? The examples:
  "Identifying energy requirement categories for given energy terms." Let''s follow
  pattern from sample titles: "Identifying Energy Terms and Their Categories". They
  used "Identifying" and topic "Energy Terms and Their Categories". That matches.
  But maybe more specific: "Identifying Energy Requirement Categories for Energy Terms".
  So Task: Identifying, Topic: Energy Requirement Categories, Key Detail: for Energy
  Terms. The guidelines: Use simple, accessible language. Avoid complex. So "Identifying
  Energy Requirement Categories for Energy Terms" seems fine. Or "Identifying Energy
  Term Categories in Biochemistry". But keep it concise. So final answer: "Identifying
  Energy Requirement Categories for Energy Terms".

bbq-thermodynamics_law_statements-questions.txt: 'Thinking...

  We need to produce a concise title, following Task + Topic + Key Detail. All problems
  are about identifying or selecting statements that match the First Law or Second
  Law of Thermodynamics. The tasks: selecting the statement that matches. Some problems
  are just "The First Law of Thermodynamics states:" maybe expecting fill in statement.
  But overall classification: Determining statements about Thermodynamics Laws. The
  tasks: Determining (or Identifying) First or Second Law statements. So title: Determining
  Thermodynamics Law Statements. Or Identifying Thermodynamics Law Statements. Need
  Task verb. The list: Identifying (MC, MA, FIB, MULTI_FIB), Matching (MATCH), Calculating
  (NUMERIC or NUM), Determining (ORDERING, TF, TFMS). For these problems: They are
  either "Select the statement that matches the First Law" - that''s Matching? But
  the pattern suggests "Identifying Thermodynamics Law Statements". That fits. Use
  Task: Identifying. Topic: Thermodynamics Law Statements. Key detail: First/Second.
  Maybe include "First/Second". Title: Identifying Thermodynamics Law Statements (First
  or Second). Or "Identifying Statements of the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics".
  Must be concise. Let''s do: Identifying Thermodynamics Law Statements. This indicates
  they are selecting or matching statements. Good.


  Check format: Task + Topic + Key Detail. "Identifying Thermodynamics Law Statements".
  That''s Task Identifying, Topic Thermodynamics Law, Key Detail Statements. Good.

bbq-thermodynamics_system_laws-questions.txt: 'Thinking...

  We need to create a concise title that classifies these problems. They are about
  thermodynamics system laws: first law and second law, different system types: open,
  closed, isolated. The tasks likely are to fill in the correct statements (maybe
  true/false, or what the total energy/entropy is). Probably a multiple choice or
  fill-in-the-blank where the answer is something like "conserved", "increases", "constant",
  etc. The title should use the format Task + Topic + Key Detail. Task verbs: Identifying,
  Matching, Calculating, Determining. These are conceptual knowledge, so "Identifying"
  or "Determining" could work. The topic: Thermodynamics System Laws. Key detail:
  Energy or Entropy, System Type. Maybe: "Determining Energy or Entropy Conservation
  in Different System Types". But we need one title for all. So maybe: "Determining
  Energy or Entropy Conservation According to Thermodynamic Laws". Task: Determining.
  Topic: Thermodynamic System Laws. Key Detail: Energy/Entropy in Open, Closed, Isolated.
  Let''s craft: "Determining Energy or Entropy Conservation in Open, Closed, and Isolated
  Systems". That seems good. Use simple language. So final answer: Determining Energy
  or Entropy Conservation in Open, Closed, and Isolated Systems.
