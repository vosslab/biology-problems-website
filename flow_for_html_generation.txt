Flow for creating website pages for a particular folder

1. Obtain the topic title
* The topic title is defined in the root-level mkdocs.yml file under the "nav" section.
Example: titles: biochemistry/topic02: "Buffer Systems and pKa"

2. Obtain the description
* The description is defined in the index.md file located in the parent folder of the topic.
Example: ./biochemistry/index.md may contain a description like:
"Topics on Molecular Design of Life and Major Concepts"

3. Identify BBQ text files
* Locate all files in the topic folder that match the pattern bbq-*.txt.
Example files in ./biochemistry/topic02/:
bbq-optimal_buffering_range-questions.txt
bbq-pKa_buffer_state-2_protons-questions.txt
bbq-pKa_buffer_state-3_protons-questions.txt

4. Run the text-to-HTML conversion script
* Use bb_text_to_html.py to convert each BBQ text file to an HTML file.
Example: ./bb_text_to_html.py bbq-optimal_buffering_range-questions.txt
This will generate a file named: optimal_buffering_range-questions.html

5. Generate a problem set title
* Use an LLM to generate a meaningful problem set title based on the content of the file.
use the ollama module on pypi
Example problem set title: "Hydrophobic Compound Based on Its Molecular Formula"

6. Add a download link
* Provide a link to download the original BBQ text file within index.md.
Example: Download the original question set
[Download the question set for Blackboard Upload](bbq-optimal_buffering_range-questions.txt)

7. Add the generated HTML to the topic's index.md file
* Insert a line in index.md to include the generated HTML file.
Example line: {% include "biochemistry/topic02/optimal_buffering_range-questions.html" %}

8. (Optional) Create a detailed markdown file
* If desired, generate a more detailed .md file with multiple questions or examples to provide additional context.

9. TODO add the QTI v2.1 for LP like Canvas or Moodle

10. Structured BBQ/task runner (optional)
* Define generation tasks in bbq_tasks.csv (chapter, topic, output_file, script, flags, input, notes).
* Use bbq_control/bbq_config.yml for path aliases and script aliases.
* Run `python3 bbq_control/run_bbq_tasks.py` to execute all tasks; stdout/stderr goes to logs/bbq_generation.log, CLI shows only progress and failures.
* Use `--dry-run` to preview commands, `--config` to point to another tasks file, `--bbq-config` for aliases, and `--log` to change the log destination.
