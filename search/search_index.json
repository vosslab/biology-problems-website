Individuals affected with color blindness have decreased ability to see colors in which they are unable distinguish between shades of red and green. The defective gene for color blindness is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28. Achondroplasia  is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. This results in a mutated protein that interacts negatively with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. The disorder affects 1 in 27,500 people. Individuals affected with achondroplasia have dwarfism with short arms and legs, an enlarged head, and a prominent forehead. The defective gene for achondroplasia is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.

This fungus exhibits a distinctive genetic feature: the formation of ordered tetrads. These ordered tetrads result from the typical two rounds of meiotic divisions followed by a single round of mitotic division within an ascus, resulting in eight ascospores arranged in a predictable sequence. The position of each ascospore reflects the series of genetic events during cell division, providing a snapshot of the meiotic process.The analysis of these ordered tetrads in Neurospora crassa allows for the classification of ascospores based on their allele arrangements into different segregation patterns.The central principle in this analysis is the distinction between first-division and second-division segregation, which is based on the behavior of alleles in the presence or absence of crossover between a gene and its centromere. When alleles separate during the first meiotic division, it indicates first-division segregation. Conversely, if alleles separate during the second division, this suggests that a crossover event has occurred, leading to second-division segregation.Counting the frequency of second-division segregation events within these ordered tetrads can provide an estimate of the genetic distance between a gene and its centromere. This frequency, reflective of the crossover events during meiosis, is used to calculate the recombination frequency. Such estimates are crucial for constructing genetic maps, which serve as a guide to the genetic landscape of Neurospora crassa, enhancing our understanding of genetic linkage and the location of genes relative to centromeres.</p> Experimental Data <p>In the table below, the six different patterns of ordered asci in Neurospora crassa are listed along with the counts found in an experiment.</p> Octad AsciCount  +   +   +   +   a   a   a   a  2,652\u00a0  +   +   a   a   +   +   a   a  787\u00a0  +   +   a   a   a   a   +   +  802\u00a0  a   a   +   +   +   +   a   a  781\u00a0  a   a   +   +   a   a   +   +  826\u00a0  a   a   a   a   +   +   +   +  2,652\u00a0 TOTAL 8,500 Distance Formula distance between a geneand its centromere = \u00bd \u00d7 (asci with second-division segregation patterns) total number of asci Question <p>Using the numbers of asci for each pattern shown in the table above, determine the genetic distance between gene A and its centromere.</p> <ul> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(781 + 802 + 826 + 2,652)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d75,061</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.2977 = 29.77 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(781 + 802 + 2,652 + 2,652)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d76,887</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.4051 = 40.51 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(2,652 + 2,652)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d75,304</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.3120 = 31.20 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(787 + 826 + 2,652 + 2,652)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d76,917</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.4069 = 40.69 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(781 + 802 + 826)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,409</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.1417 = 14.17 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(781 + 787 + 802 + 826)</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d73,196</sup>/<sub>8,500</sub> = 0.1880 = 18.80 cM </li> </ul> Check Answer"},{"location":"genetics/topic08/#gene-distance-in-a-three-gene-cross-from-unordered-tetrad-analysis","title":"Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross from Unordered Tetrad Analysis","text":"Blackboard Learn TXT  Blackboard Ultra QTI v2.1  Canvas/ADAPT QTI v1.2   Human-Readable TXT  Click             to show             Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross from Unordered Tetrad Analysis             example problem      Unordered Tetrad Three Gene Mapping <p>In this problem, you will use unordered tetrads to determine the between a single pair of genes and calculate the distances between them.

Deletions remove specific regions of the chromosome, allowing researchers to observe the effects of the missing genes on the phenotype of the organism. This approach is particularly useful for identifying the locations of recessive genes, which are only revealed when the corresponding wildtype copies are absent.In a test cross involving deletion mutants, one parent carries a full-length wildtype chromosome and a second chromosome with a deletion, while the other parent is homozygous recessive for all sixteen genes. Offspring inheriting the full-length wildtype chromosome display the dominant phenotype for all sixteen genes in the test cross. However, offspring inheriting the chromosome with the deletion will display some recessive traits. These recessive traits uncover the missing genes in the deleted region. By analyzing which genes are uncovered in a series of different deletion mutants, the linear order of the genes can be determined.In organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, polytene chromosomes from the salivary glands provide a physical map for studying deletions. Polytene chromosomes are giant chromosomes with distinct banding patterns, allowing researchers to directly visualize which regions of the chromosome are deleted. This visual representation complements the genetic data obtained from test crosses.For this problem, deletion mutants have been generated for a chromosome containing sixteen genes.
