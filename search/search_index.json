This results in shift in the green retinal receptors toward red wavelength sensitivity. The disorder affects 1 in 20 males and 1 in 400 females of Northern European ancestry. Individuals affected with color blindness have decreased ability to see colors in which they are unable distinguish between shades of red and green. The defective gene for color blindness is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28. Achondroplasia  is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. This results in a mutated protein that interacts negatively with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. The disorder affects 1 in 27,500 people. Individuals affected with achondroplasia have dwarfism with short arms and legs, an enlarged head, and a prominent forehead. The defective gene for achondroplasia is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3. A man (\u2642) with both color blindness and achondroplasia genetic disorders marries a wild-type phenotype woman (\u2640) with neither disorder.

This fungus exhibits a distinctive genetic feature: the formation of ordered tetrads. These ordered tetrads result from the typical two rounds of meiotic divisions followed by a single round of mitotic division within an ascus, resulting in eight ascospores arranged in a predictable sequence. The position of each ascospore reflects the series of genetic events during cell division, providing a snapshot of the meiotic process.The analysis of these ordered tetrads in Neurospora crassa allows for the classification of ascospores based on their allele arrangements into different segregation patterns.The central principle in this analysis is the distinction between first-division and second-division segregation, which is based on the behavior of alleles in the presence or absence of crossover between a gene and its centromere. When alleles separate during the first meiotic division, it indicates first-division segregation. Conversely, if alleles separate during the second division, this suggests that a crossover event has occurred, leading to second-division segregation.Counting the frequency of second-division segregation events within these ordered tetrads can provide an estimate of the genetic distance between a gene and its centromere. This frequency, reflective of the crossover events during meiosis, is used to calculate the recombination frequency. Such estimates are crucial for constructing genetic maps, which serve as a guide to the genetic landscape of Neurospora crassa, enhancing our understanding of genetic linkage and the location of genes relative to centromeres.</p> Experimental Data <p>In the table below, the six different patterns of ordered asci in Neurospora crassa are listed along with the counts found in an experiment.</p> Octad AsciCount  +   +   +   +   w   w   w   w  1,835\u00a0  +   +   w   w   +   +   w   w  966\u00a0  +   +   w   w   w   w   +   +  944\u00a0  w   w   +   +   +   +   w   w  1,050\u00a0  w   w   +   +   w   w   +   +  985\u00a0  w   w   w   w   +   +   +   +  1,720\u00a0 TOTAL 7,500 Distance Formula distance between a geneand its centromere = \u00bd \u00d7 (asci with second-division segregation patterns) total number of asci Question <p>Using the numbers of asci for each pattern shown in the table above, determine the genetic distance between gene W and its centromere.</p> <ul> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(985 + 1,050)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,035</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.1357 = 13.57 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(1,720 + 1,835)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d73,555</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.2370 = 23.70 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(944 + 966 + 985 + 1,835)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d74,730</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.3153 = 31.53 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(944 + 966 + 985 + 1,050)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d73,945</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.2630 = 26.30 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(985 + 1,835)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,820</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.1880 = 18.80 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(966 + 1,050 + 1,720 + 1,835)</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d75,571</sup>/<sub>7,500</sub> = 0.3714 = 37.14 cM </li> </ul> Check Answer"},{"location":"genetics/topic08/#gene-distance-in-a-three-gene-cross-from-unordered-tetrad-analysis","title":"Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross from Unordered Tetrad Analysis","text":"Blackboard Learn TXT  Blackboard Ultra QTI v2.1  Canvas/ADAPT QTI v1.2   Human-Readable TXT  Click             to show             Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross from Unordered Tetrad Analysis             example problem      Unordered Tetrad Three Gene Mapping <p>In this problem, you will use unordered tetrads to determine the between a single pair of genes and calculate the distances between them.
