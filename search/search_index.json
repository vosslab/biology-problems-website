For all other combinations, only 1 phenotype is possible.Assume complete dominance and the principle of independent assortment for all genes.Given these principles, how many unique PHENOTYPES could result from a hybrid cross between the following individuals?</p> Male (\u2642) Aa\u00a0BB\u00a0cc\u00a0dd\u00a0Ee\u00a0Ff\u00a0 Female (\u2640) Aa\u00a0bb\u00a0cc\u00a0dd\u00a0Ee\u00a0ff\u00a0 <ul> <li> 2 \u00d7 3 \u00a0 = 6 (i.e. 1 gene with two forms and 1 gene with three forms) </li> <li> 2<sup>3</sup> \u00a0 = 8 (i.e. 3 genes with two forms) </li> <li> 2<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 3 \u00a0 = 12 (i.e. 2 genes with two forms and 1 gene with three forms) </li> <li> 2<sup>4</sup> \u00a0 = 16 (i.e. 4 genes with two forms) </li> <li> 2<sup>4</sup> \u00d7 3 \u00a0 = 48 (i.e. 4 genes with two forms and 1 gene with three forms) </li> </ul> Check Answer"},{"location":"genetics/topic05/#calculating-gamete-diversity-through-independent-assortment","title":"Calculating Gamete Diversity through Independent Assortment","text":"Blackboard Learn TXT  Blackboard Ultra QTI v2.1  Canvas/ADAPT QTI v1.2   Human-Readable TXT  Click              to show             Calculating Gamete Diversity through Independent Assortment             example problem      Gamete Diversity in Sexual Reproduction <p>In sexual reproduction, the potential diversity of gametes \u2013 such as sperm and eggs in animals, or pollen and ovules in plants \u2013 can be calculated based on the genotype of an individual.How many unique GAMETES could be produced through the process of independent assortment by an individual with the following genotype?Hint: Remember, each heterozygous gene pair (like `Aa` or `Bb`) can give rise to two (2) different gametes, while homozygous pairs (like `AA`, `BB`, and `aa`, `bb`) can only give rise to one gamete.Genotype:Aa\u00a0Bb\u00a0cc\u00a0Dd\u00a0Ee\u00a0FF\u00a0GG\u00a0</p> <ul> <li> 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 (i.e., two genes with two alternative forms each) </li> <li> 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 (i.e., three genes with two alternative forms each) </li> <li> 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 (i.e., four genes with two alternative forms each) </li> <li> 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 (i.e., five genes with two alternative forms each) </li> <li> 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 (i.e., six genes with two alternative forms each) </li> </ul> Check Answer"},{"location":"genetics/topic06/","title":"6: Chromosomal Inheritance","text":"<p>Chromosome behavior in meiosis, sex-linkage, and the chromosomal basis of inheritance.</p> <p>LibreTexts reference: Chromosomal Inheritance</p>"},{"location":"genetics/topic06/#stages-and-descriptions-of-meiosis-prophase-i","title":"Stages and Descriptions of Meiosis Prophase I","text":"Blackboard Learn TXT  Blackboard Ultra QTI v2.1  Canvas/ADAPT QTI v1.2   Human-Readable TXT  Click              to show             Stages and Descriptions of Meiosis Prophase I             example problem      <p>Match each of the following stages of meiosis prophase I with their corresponding partial descriptions.Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.</p> Your Choice Prompt Drop Your Choice Here 1.

This results in shift in the green retinal receptors toward red wavelength sensitivity. The disorder affects 1 in 20 males and 1 in 400 females of Northern European ancestry. Individuals affected with color blindness have decreased ability to see colors in which they are unable distinguish between shades of red and green. The defective gene for color blindness is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28. Marfan syndrome (MFS)  is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in FBN1 gene that makes fibrillin protein. This results in weaked connective tissue throughout the body. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 people. Individuals affected with MFS have tall and thin features with serious complications involving the heart and aorta. The defective gene for MFS is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.1.

This fungus exhibits a distinctive genetic feature: the formation of ordered tetrads. These ordered tetrads result from the typical two rounds of meiotic divisions followed by a single round of mitotic division within an ascus, resulting in eight ascospores arranged in a predictable sequence. The position of each ascospore reflects the series of genetic events during cell division, providing a snapshot of the meiotic process.The analysis of these ordered tetrads in Neurospora crassa allows for the classification of ascospores based on their allele arrangements into different segregation patterns.The central principle in this analysis is the distinction between first-division and second-division segregation, which is based on the behavior of alleles in the presence or absence of crossover between a gene and its centromere. When alleles separate during the first meiotic division, it indicates first-division segregation. Conversely, if alleles separate during the second division, this suggests that a crossover event has occurred, leading to second-division segregation.Counting the frequency of second-division segregation events within these ordered tetrads can provide an estimate of the genetic distance between a gene and its centromere. This frequency, reflective of the crossover events during meiosis, is used to calculate the recombination frequency. Such estimates are crucial for constructing genetic maps, which serve as a guide to the genetic landscape of Neurospora crassa, enhancing our understanding of genetic linkage and the location of genes relative to centromeres.</p> Experimental Data <p>In the table below, the six different patterns of ordered asci in Neurospora crassa are listed along with the counts found in an experiment.</p> Octad AsciCount  +   +   +   +   a   a   a   a  1,488\u00a0  +   +   a   a   +   +   a   a  387\u00a0  +   +   a   a   a   a   +   +  381\u00a0  a   a   +   +   +   +   a   a  374\u00a0  a   a   +   +   a   a   +   +  352\u00a0  a   a   a   a   +   +   +   +  1,518\u00a0 TOTAL 4,500 Distance Formula distance between a geneand its centromere = \u00bd \u00d7 (asci with second-division segregation patterns) total number of asci Question <p>Using the numbers of asci for each pattern shown in the table above, determine the genetic distance between gene A and its centromere.</p> <ul> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(352 + 374 + 381 + 1,488)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,595</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.2883 = 28.83 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(352 + 374 + 1,518)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,244</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.2493 = 24.93 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(374 + 387 + 1,488)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d72,249</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.2499 = 24.99 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(374 + 387 + 1,488 + 1,518)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d73,767</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.4186 = 41.86 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(352 + 374 + 381 + 387)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d71,494</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.1660 = 16.60 cM </li> <li> <sup>\u00bd\u00d7(1,488 + 1,518)</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = <sup>\u00bd\u00d73,006</sup>/<sub>4,500</sub> = 0.3340 = 33.40 cM </li> </ul> Check Answer"},{"location":"genetics/topic08/#unordered-tetrad-analysis-calculating-gene-distance-in-a-three-gene-cross","title":"Unordered Tetrad Analysis: Calculating Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross","text":"Blackboard Learn TXT  Blackboard Ultra QTI v2.1  Canvas/ADAPT QTI v1.2  Click              to show             Unordered Tetrad Analysis: Calculating Gene Distance in a Three-Gene Cross             example problem      Unordered Tetrad Three Gene Mapping <p>In this problem, you will use unordered tetrads to determine the between a single pair of genes and calculate the distances between them.

Deletions remove specific regions of the chromosome, allowing researchers to observe the effects of the missing genes on the phenotype of the organism. This approach is particularly useful for identifying the locations of recessive genes, which are only revealed when the corresponding wildtype copies are absent.In a test cross involving deletion mutants, one parent carries a full-length wildtype chromosome and a second chromosome with a deletion, while the other parent is homozygous recessive for all four genes. Offspring inheriting the full-length wildtype chromosome display the dominant phenotype for all four genes in the test cross. However, offspring inheriting the chromosome with the deletion will display some recessive traits. These recessive traits uncover the missing genes in the deleted region. By analyzing which genes are uncovered in a series of different deletion mutants, the linear order of the genes can be determined.For this problem, deletion mutants have been generated for a chromosome containing four genes. Your goal is to analyze the phenotypic data resulting from these deletions and determine the correct linear order of the genes.There are four (4) genes, F, Q, T, and X, closely linked in a single chromosome.
