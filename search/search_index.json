Individuals affected with color blindness have decreased ability to see colors in which they are unable distinguish between shades of red and green. The defective gene for color blindness is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28. Achondroplasia  is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. This results in a mutated protein that interacts negatively with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. The disorder affects 1 in 27,500 people. Individuals affected with achondroplasia have dwarfism with short arms and legs, an enlarged head, and a prominent forehead. The defective gene for achondroplasia is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.
