1. In a reciprocal translocation, two nonhomologous chromosomes each break once and exchange their terminal fragments. Gene order within each fragment is preserved; only the junctions change.
Two chromosomes with the gene sequences ◀ EFGH IJKL▶ and ◀ PQR STUVWX▶ undergo a reciprocal translocation after breaks between H ⏐ I and R ⏐ S, where the symbols: ◀ and ▶ represent the telomeres. 
Which one of the following is NOT a possible product of this translocation?
- [ ] A. LKJI ≡ RQP
- [*] B. HGFE ≡ RQP
- [ ] C. EFGH ≡ RQP
- [ ] D. LKJI ≡ STUVWX
- [ ] E. EFGH ≡ STUVWX
