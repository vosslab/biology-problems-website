88. In a standard dihybrid cross involving two independent genes, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 . A test-cross with an F1 individual and a double recessive usually yields a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio if the genes assort independently.
In a specific cross, F2 progeny exhibit a modified dihybrid ratio of 9:6:1 (instead of 9:3:3:1).
What phenotypic ratio would be expected from a test-cross with an individual from the F1 progeny?
- [ ] A. a ratio of 1:1:3
- [*] B. a ratio of 1:2:1 or 1:1:2
- [ ] C. a ratio of 1:2:2
- [ ] D. a ratio of 2:2:1


89. In a standard dihybrid cross involving two independent genes, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 . A test-cross with an F1 individual and a double recessive usually yields a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio if the genes assort independently.
In a specific cross, F2 progeny exhibit a modified dihybrid ratio of 9:4:3 (instead of 9:3:3:1).
What phenotypic ratio would be expected from a test-cross with an individual from the F1 progeny?
- [ ] A. a ratio of 1:1:1
- [*] B. a ratio of 1:2:1 or 1:1:2
- [ ] C. a ratio of 1:3:1
- [ ] D. a ratio of 3:1:1
