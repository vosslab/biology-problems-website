1. Gamete Diversity in Sexual ReproductionIn sexual reproduction, the potential diversity of gametes – such as sperm and eggs in animals, or pollen and ovules in plants – can be calculated based on the genotype of an individual.
How many unique GAMETES could be produced through the process of independent assortment by an individual with the following genotype?
 Hint: Remember, each heterozygous gene pair (like `Aa` or `Bb`) can give rise to two (2) different gametes, while homozygous pairs (like `AA`, `BB`, and `aa`, `bb`) can only give rise to one gamete. 
 Genotype: aa Bb Cc DD Ee FF Gg
- [ ] A. 22 = 4 (i.e., two genes with two alternative forms each)
- [ ] B. 23 = 8 (i.e., three genes with two alternative forms each)
- [*] C. 24 = 16 (i.e., four genes with two alternative forms each)
- [ ] D. 25 = 32 (i.e., five genes with two alternative forms each)
- [ ] E. 26 = 64 (i.e., six genes with two alternative forms each)

30. Gamete Diversity in Sexual ReproductionIn sexual reproduction, the potential diversity of gametes – such as sperm and eggs in animals, or pollen and ovules in plants – can be calculated based on the genotype of an individual.
How many unique GAMETES could be produced through the process of independent assortment by an individual with the following genotype?
 Hint: Remember, each heterozygous gene pair (like `Aa` or `Bb`) can give rise to two (2) different gametes, while homozygous pairs (like `AA`, `BB`, and `aa`, `bb`) can only give rise to one gamete.

88. Gamete Diversity in Sexual ReproductionIn sexual reproduction, the potential diversity of gametes – such as sperm and eggs in animals, or pollen and ovules in plants – can be calculated based on the genotype of an individual.
How many unique GAMETES could be produced through the process of independent assortment by an individual with the following genotype?
 Hint: Remember, each heterozygous gene pair (like `Aa` or `Bb`) can give rise to two (2) different gametes, while homozygous pairs (like `AA`, `BB`, and `aa`, `bb`) can only give rise to one gamete.
