- 1. aa × aa / A. Produces offspring that are all homozygous recessive
- 2. Aa × Aa / B. One-quarter of the offspring show the recessive phenotype
- 3. AA × Aa / C. Yields offspring with 50% homozygous dominant and 50% heterozygous genotypes
- 4. Aa × aa / D. 50% of the offspring are homozygous recessive
- 5. AA × aa / E. All offspring have the dominant phenotype and are heterozygous
- 6. AA × AA / F. Results in all homozygous dominant offspring


96. Match each of the following parental genotypes in monohybrid crosses with their corresponding descriptions of the progeny.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1. AA × Aa / A. Yields offspring with 50% homozygous dominant and 50% heterozygous genotypes
- 2. Aa × aa / B. 50% of the offspring are homozygous recessive
- 3. AA × aa / C. All offspring have the dominant phenotype and are heterozygous
- 4. Aa × Aa / D. One-quarter of the offspring show the recessive phenotype
- 5. aa × aa / E. Produces only the recessive phenotype in progeny
- 6. AA × AA / F. All offspring have the same dominant genotype and phenotype


97. Match each of the following parental genotypes in monohybrid crosses with their corresponding descriptions of the progeny.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1. aa × aa / A. Produces only the recessive phenotype in progeny
- 2. AA × Aa / B. Yields offspring with 50% homozygous dominant and 50% heterozygous genotypes
- 3. Aa × Aa / C. Produces a 3:1 phenotype ratio in progeny
- 4. AA × aa / D. Results in all heterozygous offspring
- 5. Aa × aa / E. Produces a 1:1 phenotype ratio in progeny
- 6. AA × AA / F. All offspring have the same dominant genotype and phenotype


98. Match each of the following parental genotypes in monohybrid crosses with their corresponding descriptions of the progeny.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1. AA × Aa / A. Yields offspring with 50% homozygous dominant and 50% heterozygous genotypes
- 2. aa × aa / B. All offspring have the same recessive genotype and phenotype
- 3. AA × aa / C. Produces only heterozygotes in progeny
- 4. AA × AA / D. All offspring have the same dominant genotype and phenotype
- 5. Aa × Aa / E. Produces a 1:2:1 genotype ratio in progeny
- 6. Aa × aa / F. Half of the offspring display the recessive phenotype


99. Match each of the following parental genotypes in monohybrid crosses with their corresponding descriptions of the progeny.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
