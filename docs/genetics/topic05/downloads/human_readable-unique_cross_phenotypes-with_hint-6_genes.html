1. Phenotype Diversity in Hybrid CrossIn a hybrid cross, you can determine the variety of phenotypes in the offspring by examining the genetic makeup of the parents. Specifically, look at whether each gene can be dominant, recessive, or both.
A dominant gene can mask the effect of its recessive counterpart, thus influencing the number of unique phenotypes.
 Hint: To find the number of unique phenotypes, consider each gene pair. 
For gene pairs with at least one heterozygous and one either heterozygous or homozygous recessive gene, 2 phenotypes are possible. 
For all other combinations, only 1 phenotype is possible. 
Assume complete dominance and the principle of independent assortment for all genes.
Given these principles, how many unique PHENOTYPES could result from a hybrid cross between the following individuals? [TABLE]
- [ ] A. 22 = 4 ( i.e. 2 genes with two forms)

50. Phenotype Diversity in Hybrid CrossIn a hybrid cross, you can determine the variety of phenotypes in the offspring by examining the genetic makeup of the parents. Specifically, look at whether each gene can be dominant, recessive, or both.
A dominant gene can mask the effect of its recessive counterpart, thus influencing the number of unique phenotypes.
 Hint: To find the number of unique phenotypes, consider each gene pair. 
For gene pairs with at least one heterozygous and one either heterozygous or homozygous recessive gene, 2 phenotypes are possible. 
For all other combinations, only 1 phenotype is possible. 
Assume complete dominance and the principle of independent assortment for all genes.

75. Phenotype Diversity in Hybrid CrossIn a hybrid cross, you can determine the variety of phenotypes in the offspring by examining the genetic makeup of the parents. Specifically, look at whether each gene can be dominant, recessive, or both.
A dominant gene can mask the effect of its recessive counterpart, thus influencing the number of unique phenotypes.
 Hint: To find the number of unique phenotypes, consider each gene pair. 
For gene pairs with at least one heterozygous and one either heterozygous or homozygous recessive gene, 2 phenotypes are possible. 
For all other combinations, only 1 phenotype is possible. 
Assume complete dominance and the principle of independent assortment for all genes.

A dominant gene can mask the effect of its recessive counterpart, thus influencing the number of unique phenotypes.
 Hint: To find the number of unique phenotypes, consider each gene pair. 
For gene pairs with at least one heterozygous and one either heterozygous or homozygous recessive gene, 2 phenotypes are possible. 
For all other combinations, only 1 phenotype is possible. 
Assume complete dominance and the principle of independent assortment for all genes.
Given these principles, how many unique PHENOTYPES could result from a hybrid cross between the following individuals? [TABLE]
- [ ] A. 22 = 4 ( i.e. 2 genes with two forms)
- [ ] B. 2 × 3 = 6 ( i.e. 1 gene with two forms and 1 gene with three forms)
- [*] C. 23 = 8 ( i.e. 3 genes with two forms)
- [ ] D. 22 × 3 = 12 ( i.e. 2 genes with two forms and 1 gene with three forms)
- [ ] E. 24 × 3 = 48 ( i.e. 4 genes with two forms and 1 gene with three forms)
