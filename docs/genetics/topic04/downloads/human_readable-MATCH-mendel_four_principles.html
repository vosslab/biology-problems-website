1. Match each of the following Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.            Law of Segregation / A. Two allele s for a character are randomly distributed into different gamete s .
- 2.        Principle of Dominance / B. In cases where contrasting allele s are present, the dominant allele determines the phenotype .
- 3. Law of Independent Assortment / C. Each pair of traits is passed down without any impact on the passage of other pairs during the creation of gamete s .
- 4.   Principle of Paired Factors / D. Each organism has two allele s that make up the characters for a given trait.


2. Match each of the following Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.            Law of Segregation / A. Each parent contributes just one of their two allele s to its offspring.
- 2. Law of Independent Assortment / B. The inheritance of one gene does NOT impact the inheritance of another separate gene.
- 3.   Principle of Paired Factors / C. The genetic makeup for a particular characteristic in an organism involves two allele s .
- 4.        Principle of Dominance / D. In cases where contrasting allele s are present, the dominant allele determines the phenotype .


3. Match each of the following Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.            Law of Segregation / A. When the gamete s are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete .
- 2. Law of Independent Assortment / B. The inheritance of one trait doesn't influence the inheritance of another.
- 3.        Principle of Dominance / C. For each characters there is a dominant allele , the phenotype is determined by that allele .
- 4.   Principle of Paired Factors / D. The genetic makeup for each character involves two allele s .


4. Match each of the following Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics with their corresponding descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.        Principle of Dominance / A. Out of the two different allele s for the same gene, only one is able to express its effect.
- 2.            Law of Segregation / B. Two allele s for a character are randomly distributed into different gamete s .
- 3. Law of Independent Assortment / C. Traits from different genes are passed down separate ly from one another.
- 4.   Principle of Paired Factors / D. For every characteristic, an organism possesses two allele s .
