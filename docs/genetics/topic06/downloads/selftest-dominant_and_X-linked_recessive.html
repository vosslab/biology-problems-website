<div id="statement_text_6ffb_32d5"><p><strong>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) </strong> is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the DMD gene. This results in dystrophin is responsible for connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in muscle cells. The disorder affects 1 in 20,000 males. Individuals affected with DMD have muscle weakness, trouble standing up, which eventually leads to loss of skeletal muscle control, respiratory failure, and death. The defective gene for DMD is located on the short arm of chromosome X at position 21.2. <br><strong>Marfan syndrome (MFS) </strong> is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in FBN1 gene that makes fibrillin protein. This results in weaked connective tissue throughout the body. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 people. Individuals affected with MFS have tall and thin features with serious complications involving the heart and aorta. The defective gene for MFS is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.1. <br>A man (&male;) with both DMD and MFS genetic disorders marries a wild-type phenotype woman (&female;) with neither disorder. The father (&male;) of the woman has the DMD genetic disorder,but mother (&female;) of the woman does not. The mother (&female;) of the man is wild-type phenotype and does not have the MFS genetic disorder.<br>Reminder: DMD is X-linked recessive and MFS is autosomal dominant.<br>What fraction of their daughters (&female;) will have both DMD and MFS genetic disorders?</p></div>
