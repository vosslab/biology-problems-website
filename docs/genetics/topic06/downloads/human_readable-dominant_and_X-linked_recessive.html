1. Hemophilia A (HemA) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the HEMA gene. This results in blood cannot clot properly due to a deficiency of a clotting factor. The disorder affects 1 in 1,000 American males. Individuals affected with HemA have prolonged bleeding from common injuries. The defective gene for HemA is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 28. 
 Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by an increase in trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene. This results in a mutated Huntington protein that is toxic to certain cell types, particularly brain cells. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 adults of European descent. Individuals affected with HD have physical abilities that gradually worsen and mental abilities that decline into dementia. The defective gene for HD is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3. 
A man (♂) with both HemA and HD genetic disorders marries a wild-type phenotype woman (♀) with neither disorder. The father (♂) of the woman has the HemA genetic disorder,but mother (♀) of the woman does not. The father (♂) of the man is wild-type phenotype and does not have the HD genetic disorder.

This results in partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens. The disorder affects 1 in 20,000. Individuals affected with AIS have impaired development of male genitals and male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. The defective gene for AIS is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 11. 
 Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by an increase in trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene. This results in a mutated Huntington protein that is toxic to certain cell types, particularly brain cells. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 adults of European descent. Individuals affected with HD have physical abilities that gradually worsen and mental abilities that decline into dementia. The defective gene for HD is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.
