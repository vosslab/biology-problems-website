- 1.                   Leptotene / A. chromosomes start to condense
- 2. Diplotene and/or Diakinesis / B. characterized by shortening and thickening of the paired chromosomes
- 3.        Early/Late Pachytene / C. crossing-over occurs between homologous chromosomes
- 4.                    Zygotene / D. the pairing of homologous chromosomes begins


99. Match each of the following stages of meiosis prophase I with their corresponding partial descriptions.
 Note: Each choice will be used exactly once.
- 1.                    Zygotene / A. strands of homologous chromosomes line up and become pairs
- 2.                   Leptotene / B. chromosomes first become visible in the form of thread-like structures
- 3. Diplotene and/or Diakinesis / C. the paired chromosomes being to separate
- 4.        Early/Late Pachytene / D. the swapping of genetic material occurs between homologous chromosomes
