 Your lab partner is trying again (eye roll) and did another a chi-squared (χ²) test on the F2 generation in a dihybid cross based on your lab data (above). They wanted to know if the results confirm the expected phenotype ratios.
You helped them set up the null hypothesis, so you know that part is correct, but they got confused and were unsure about how to calculate the chi-squared (χ²) value. So much so that they did it three (3) different ways.
Before you ask your instructor for a new lab partner, tell them which table is correct AND whether they can accept or reject the null hypothesis using the information provided.
- [ ] A. Table 1 with χ² = 16.232 is correct and we REJECT the null hypothesis

 Your lab partner is trying again (eye roll) and did another a chi-squared (χ²) test on the F2 generation in a dihybid cross based on your lab data (above). They wanted to know if the results confirm the expected phenotype ratios.
You helped them set up the null hypothesis, so you know that part is correct, but they got confused and were unsure about how to calculate the chi-squared (χ²) value. So much so that they did it three (3) different ways.
Before you ask your instructor for a new lab partner, tell them which table is correct AND whether they can accept or reject the null hypothesis using the information provided.
