1. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene T is connected with the ' tipsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene T moves in an erratic path, suggesting a lack of coordination, as if intoxicated. 
* Gene Y is associated with the ' yucky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene Y gives off an unpleasant odor and has a generally unappealing look. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

99. Two-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a two-point test cross examines two (2) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard two-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for both genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for both genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for two genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene D is associated with the ' dewy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene D appears moist, with its body covered in tiny droplets of water. 
* Gene W is correlated with the ' waxy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene W has a thick protective layer that is water resistant and opague. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
