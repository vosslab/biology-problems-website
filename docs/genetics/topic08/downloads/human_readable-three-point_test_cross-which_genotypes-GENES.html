1. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene B is affiliated with the ' bumpy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene B has a skin texture that is not smooth, but rough with small bumps all over. 
* Gene D is connected with the ' dewy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene D appears moist, with its body covered in tiny droplets of water. 
* Gene K is related to the ' kidney ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene K has a body shape that is curved, similar to a kidney bean. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the all recombinant genotypes for genes K and B . These genotypes result from crossover events that occur between the two genes K and B during meiosis.
More than one genotype will be correct. Select all that apply.

It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene C is correlated with the ' chummy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene C shows behavior where it always maintains a close distance to other flies. 
* Gene J is associated with the ' jerky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene J moves in rapid and sudden movements, displaying an unpredictable flight pattern. 
* Gene R is analogous to the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the all recombinant genotypes for genes J and R . These genotypes result from crossover events that occur between the two genes J and R during meiosis.
More than one genotype will be correct. Select all that apply.

99. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene A is connected with the ' artsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene A has wings that are colorful and distinctive patterns. 
* Gene K is affiliated with the ' kidney ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene K has a body shape that is curved, similar to a kidney bean. 
* Gene X is linked with the ' xanthic ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene X has a fluorescent bright yellow coloring. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the all recombinant genotypes for genes A and X . These genotypes result from crossover events that occur between the two genes A and X during meiosis.
More than one genotype will be correct. Select all that apply.
- [*] A. akx
- [ ] B. ak+
- [*] C. a+x
- [ ] D. a++
- [ ] E. +kx
- [*] F. +k+
- [ ] G. ++x
