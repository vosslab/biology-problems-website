1. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene B is linked with the ' bumpy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene B has a skin texture that is not smooth, but rough with small bumps all over. 
* Gene N is linked with the ' nerdy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene N has large, prominent eyes that stand out, much like thick-rimmed glasses. 
* Gene R is connected with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
Question Based on the traits expressed in the offspring, identify the double crossover genotype combinations . These allele combinations are a result of two genetic crossover events.
More than one genotype will be correct. Select all that apply.

21. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene C is affiliated with the ' chummy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene C shows behavior where it always maintains a close distance to other flies. 
* Gene R is associated with the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. 
* Gene T is correlated with the ' tipsy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene T moves in an erratic path, suggesting a lack of coordination, as if intoxicated. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

41. Three-Point Test Cross ProblemA test cross is a way to explore the relationship between genes and their respective alleles. It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene P is linked with the ' prickly ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene P is covered with sharp bristles, giving it a spiky texture. 
* Gene R is analogous to the ' rusty ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene R has a reddish-brown color, much like rusted iron metal. 
* Gene Y is affiliated with the ' yucky ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene Y gives off an unpleasant odor and has a generally unappealing look. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.

It is a useful tool for genetic mapping and deciphering the inheritance of traits. Specifically, a three-point test cross examines three (3) genes at the same time to learn about their assortment in gamete formation.
A standard three-point test cross involves crossing a heterozygous organism for all three genes with an organism that is homozygous recessive for all three genes
For this problem, a test cross using a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) heterozygous for three genes was conducted to understand their genetic interactions.
Characteristics of Recessive Phenotypes
* Gene F is correlated with the ' fuzzy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene F is covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a soft appearance. 
* Gene N is related to the ' nerdy ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene N has large, prominent eyes that stand out, much like thick-rimmed glasses. 
* Gene P is associated with the ' prickly ' phenotype. A fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for Gene P is covered with sharp bristles, giving it a spiky texture. [TABLE] The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
The resulting phenotypes are summarized in the table above.
