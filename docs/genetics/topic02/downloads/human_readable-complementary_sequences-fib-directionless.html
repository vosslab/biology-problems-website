1. DNA is organized as a double helix where two strands run in opposite, or anti-parallel, directions. The ends of these strands are referred to as 5′ (five prime) and 3′ (three prime) ends. The strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. Specifically, adenine (A) forms a pair with thymine (T) , and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C) . This base pairing is critical for the stability of the DNA molecule and is central to processes like DNA replication and transcription.
