The α-helix is a right-handed coil in which each backbone N–H group forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of an amino acid located a few residues away. The regular pattern of hydrogen bonding stabilizes the helix, preventing it from unraveling.
In a long α-helix, amino acid number 7 would form a hydrogen bond with which two other amino acids?
Select the correct pair of amino acids below.
- [ ] A. amino acids 5 and 9 (a residue shift of 2 positions) 
- [ ] B. amino acids 4 and 10 (a residue shift of 3 positions)
