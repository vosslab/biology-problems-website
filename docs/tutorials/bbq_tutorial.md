# **Tutorial: Creating a Randomized Test in Blackboard**

## **Introduction**
Creating a randomized test in Blackboard ensures that each student receives a unique question set, enhancing test security and fairness. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a test using question pools and random blocks.

---

## **Part 1: Build an Empty Pool**
In this part, we will create an empty question pool to store the test questions we plan to upload. A **question pool** in Blackboard serves as a collection of reusable questions that can be pulled into quizzes, tests, or exams.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the **Test, Pools, and Surveys** section.
2. Click on **Pools**.
   ![Screenshot of the Blackboard menu displaying the "Tests, Surveys, and Pools" section, with the "Pools" option highlighted.](bbq_how_to/step_01-menu-test_surveys_pools.png)

3. Here is the **main Pools menu** where all created pools will be listed. Since we haven't created any yet, the list is empty.
   ![Blackboard interface showing the "Pools" section with options to "Build Pool," "Import Pool," and "Import QTI 2.1 Package," but no existing pools.](bbq_how_to/step_02-menu-empty_pools.png)

4. Click on **Build Pool** to start creating a new pool.

## **Part 2: Import the BBQ Text Questions**
Now that we have a **question pool**, we need to populate it with questions. Instead of adding them manually, we will **upload a batch of questions** using a preformatted BBQ text file.

**Steps:**
1. While inside the **Pool** information page, click **Upload Questions** from the menu.
   ![Cursor hovering over the "Upload Questions" button on the "Pool information page"" of Blackboard.](bbq_how_to/step_07-select_upload_questions.png)

2. This is the **Upload Questions** screen. Here, we will select the BBQ text file containing the questions. Click **Browse Local Files** to locate the file on your computer.
   ![Blackboard's "Upload Questions" screen, with options to browse for a file and set point values.](bbq_how_to/step_08-upload_questions_screen.png)

3. After selecting the file, enter a point value for the questions, and click **Submit** to upload it.
   ![Cursor clicking the "Submit" button after selecting the BBQ text file for upload.](bbq_how_to/step_09-upload_questions_submit.png)

4. If the upload is successful, you will see a **confirmation message**.
   ![A purple confirmation banner saying "Success: 99 questions uploaded," with a summary of the uploaded questions.](bbq_how_to/step_10-upload_success.png)

5. Scroll down and you can see the list of imported questions. You can review them to ensure they were uploaded correctly.

## **Part 3: Build an Empty Test "Assignment"**
Now that we have a **question pool** filled with questions, we need to create a test that students will take. This test, also referred to as an **assignment**, will be set up in Blackboard and later linked to the pool of questions.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the **Tests** section in Blackboard by selecting **Tests, Surveys, and Pools**, then clicking **Tests**.
   ![Cursor selecting the "Tests" tab in Blackboard, preparing to create a new test.](bbq_how_to/step_12-select_tests.png)

2. This is the **Tests** menu. Since no tests exist yet, we need to create a new one. Click **Build Test**.
   ![Blackboardâ€™s "Tests" section, currently empty, displaying the "Build Test" button.](bbq_how_to/step_13-menu-empty_tests.png)

3. In the dropdown, click **Build Test** to start creating the test.
   ![Cursor clicking "Build Test" to start creating a new test.](bbq_how_to/step_14-select_build_test.png)

4. This is the **Test Information** page. Here, enter a **test name**, an optional **description**, and any **instructions** for students.
   ![Test information screen with fields to enter a test name, description, and instructions.](bbq_how_to/step_15-test_info_screen.png)

5. Once you've entered the test details, click **Submit** to save your test.
   ![Cursor clicking the "Submit" button to save the test details.](bbq_how_to/step_16-submit_test.png)

6. You will see a **confirmation message** indicating that your test has been successfully created.
   ![A purple confirmation banner at the top of the screen indicating "Success: my first assignment created." ](bbq_how_to/step_17-test_create_success.png)

At this point, we have successfully **built an empty test**. In the next step, we will add **randomized questions from the question pool** to ensure each student gets a unique set of questions.

---

## **Part 4: Add a Random Block to the Assignment of the Pooled Questions**
Random blocks pull a set number of questions from a pool to ensure variation. This ensures each student gets a different combination of questions, making tests fairer and reducing the likelihood of answer sharing.

**Steps:**

1. On the **Test Information** page, click **Reuse Question > Create Random Block**. This allows you to pull a set of randomized questions from the pool.

   ![Cursor hovering over the "Reuse Question" menu, selecting "Create Random Block." ](bbq_how_to/step_18-select_create_random_block.png)

2. A pop-up window will appear, asking you to select the **question pool**. Choose the question pool you created earlier.

   ![Popup window displaying available question pools, with one selected.](bbq_how_to/step_19-random_block_popup.png)

3. Select **All Pool Questions** to ensure that Blackboard pulls from the full list of available questions.

   ![Pop-up window with the mouse pointer hovering over "All Questions" unselected and the question pool empty.](bbq_how_to/step_20-select_all_questions.png)

4. Once selected, the question block area will display the questions from your pool.

   ![Pop-up window with the mouse pointer hovering over "All Questions" now selected and a list of questions displayed.](bbq_how_to/step_21-all_questions_selected.png)

5. Verify that the correct questions have been added to the test. Click **Submit** to finalize the random block settings.

   ![Scrolled down from before, highlighting the list of questions and the mouse hovered over the submit button.](bbq_how_to/step_22-submit_random_pool.png)

6. After submitting, you will see a **success message**. The test now contains a **randomized question block**, meaning every student will receive a unique set of questions each time they take the test.

   ![Confirmation message at the top of the screen confirming "Random block successfully created." ](bbq_how_to/step_23-random_block_success.png)

7. At this point, you can specify the **number of questions** to be pulled from the pool for each student and adjust the **point value** for each question.

   ![Final view of the test editor with the randomized block successfully added.](bbq_how_to/step_24-random_block_plain.png)

In the next step, we will make the test available to students and configure additional test settings.

## **Part 5: Make the Assignment Available to Students**

### **Sub Part 5a: Add the Test to the Course**

Now that the test is created and contains a randomized question block, we need to make it available to students by adding it to the **Assignments Content Area**.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the **Assignments Content Area** where students will access the test.

   ![An empty "Assignments Content Area" prompting the user to add content using the menu above.](bbq_how_to/step_25-content_area.png)

2. Click on **Assessments**, then select **Test** from the dropdown menu.

   ![Cursor selecting "Test" from the "Assessments" dropdown in the "Assignments Content Area." ](bbq_how_to/step_26-select_test.png)

3. The **Add Test** menu will appear. Select the test you created earlier (e.g., "My First Assignment").

   !["Add Test" menu appears, with "my first assignment" highlighted as the selected test.](bbq_how_to/step_27-add_test_menu.png)

4. Click **Submit** to attach the test to the course.

   ![A purple banner at the top confirms "Success: my first assignment created."](bbq_how_to/step_28-test_info_menu_sucess.png)

At this stage, the test is now linked to the **Assignments Content Area**, but we still need to configure additional settings to control availability and access for students.

### **Sub Part 5b: Customize Test Settings**
Now that the test has been added to the course, we must configure its settings in the **Test Options** menu. These settings determine how and when students can access the test.

**Steps:**

1. Select **Yes** to make the test available to students.

   ![Cursor selecting "Yes" to make the test available to students in the "Test Options" menu.](bbq_how_to/step_29-test_info_options_1.png)

2. If you want students to have multiple attempts, choose an **attempt limit** and select a scoring method (e.g., highest grade).

   ![Dropdown menu expanded, with "Highest Grade" selected as the scoring option for multiple attempts.](bbq_how_to/step_30-test_info_options_2.png)

3. If you want to set a time limit, check **Set Timer**, enter the duration, and enable **Auto-Submit** if desired.

   ![Blackboard test settings screen showing the "Set Timer" option checked with a duration of 10 minutes and auto-submit enabled.](bbq_how_to/step_31-test_info_options_3.png)

4. Define the **Due Date** for the test and select the option to prevent students from starting the test after the deadline.
