# **Tutorial: Creating a Randomized Test in Canvas**

## **Introduction**
Creating a randomized quiz in Canvas allows you to pull unique question sets for each student, enhancing both test security and fairness. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a Question Bank and creating a Question Group to randomize questions for your quiz.

## **Part 1: Upload Questions**
In this section, we will upload the questions to Canvas using QTI .zip files. This format allows you to easily transfer the questions into Canvas and get them ready for use in quizzes.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Settings:** On the bottom left-hand side of your course, click on **Settings**.

1. **Go to Import Course Content:** On the right-hand side, in the middle of the page, click on **Import Course Content.**
![Canvas course settings menu with the “Import Course Content” option highlighted at the bottom by a red box and arrow.](canvas_how_to/Step_01_02-select_import_course_content.png){ width=40% }

1. **Select Content Type:** Under **"Select Content Type"**, open the drop-down menu and choose **"QTI .zip file"** at the bottom of the list.

## **Part 2 (Optional): Rename your Question Bank**
Now that we have uploaded the questions to Canvas, we can rename the file to make it easier to identify the question bank when setting up the randomization process.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Quizzes:** On the middle left-hand side of your course, click on **Quizzes**.
![Canvas course navigation menu with the “Quizzes” link highlighted by a red box and arrow.](canvas_how_to/Step_02_01-select_Quizzes.png){ width=45% }

2. **In the top-right corner**, click the three dots next to the **+ Quiz button**. A drop-down menu will appear. Then, click on **Manage Question Banks**.

3. You will see a list of the uploaded .zip files containing the questions for this course. To rename a questions bank, click the **pencil icon** to the right of the name, enter your desired name, and press **Enter**.
