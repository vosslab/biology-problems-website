# Usage

Use MkDocs to serve the local development site or build the static output from
[site_docs/](../site_docs/) using [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml).

## Quick start
From the repo root:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## CLI
- Serve the site locally:
  ```bash
  mkdocs serve
  ```
- Build the static site:
  ```bash
  mkdocs build
  ```

## Examples
- Serve locally for preview:
  ```bash
  mkdocs serve
  ```
- Build output into [site/](../site/):
  ```bash
  mkdocs build
  ```

## Inputs and outputs
- Inputs: [site_docs/](../site_docs/) content and [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml) config.
- Outputs: [site/](../site/) static site files (generated by `mkdocs build`).

## Known gaps
- Confirm any additional first-class workflows beyond MkDocs (for example, BBQ task
  runners) that need usage docs.
